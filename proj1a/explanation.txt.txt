Let me just preface this by saying I apologize that I am submitting my project 1a late. This week 
has been pretty hectic for me for a number of reasons. Finding housing was a big time consumer. My future
roommates and I had to close a leasing option for our next semester which ended up eating more into my week
than I thought. And this project also required more than I allotted time for. I stayed at 3 labs this week to 
get extra help and have spent around 20 hours outside of that, but I was still not able to finish in time. 
I will try my best to make sure I don't have to resort to submitting late next time, thank you for your 
understanding.
