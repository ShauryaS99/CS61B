This week has been pretty hectic for me mostly because of housing. Finding housing was a big time consumer. My 
futureroommates and I had to close a leasing option for our next semester which ended up eating more into my week
than I thought. And this project also required more than I allotted time for. I stayed at 3 labs this week to 
get extra help and have spent around 20 hours outside of that, but I was still not able to finish in time. 
Thank you for your understanding.
