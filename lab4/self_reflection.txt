All questions are optional, though try to answer at least 4. The main goal of this file is to get you thinking critically about your own work, but we will also use these self reflections at the end of the semester when we do our internal review of the course.

ArrayDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: Using a final static variable for the intial size of the array would have been a good idea
   Also their resizing method was less complicated, instead of reordering the array like I did they just copied it and moved the pointers

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: Just working out how the deque's were supposed to work, brainstorming solutions and implementing them by myself.

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: My resize method

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing ArrayDeque?

A: It helps to run your ideas through TA's and lab assistants

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing ArrayDeque, if anything?

A: Nothing

Q: If you wrote ArrayDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: My resize method to make it less convoluted and more effecient

LinkedListDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: Nothing 

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: Just working out how the deque's were supposed to work, brainstorming solutions and implementing them by myself correctly.

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: For my linked list it was pretty similar to the staff solution

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing LinkedListDeque?

A: He implemented tests for certain functions which may have been helpful

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing LinkedListDeque, if anything?

A: Nothing

Q: If you wrote LinkedListDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: Not much, I may have written more tests

Meta:

Q: Did you like this design review process? Anything we should do differently next time?

A: Maybe be a bit more clear and give more examples of the deques were supposed to work like how you did in the slides
